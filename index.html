      <p>Physical chemistry, Branch of chemistry concerned with interactions and transformations of materials. Unlike other branches, it deals with the principles of physics underlying all chemical interactions (e.g., gas laws), seeking to measure, correlate, and explain the quantitative aspects of reactions. Quantum mechanics has clarified much for physical chemistry by modeling the smallest particles ordinarily dealt with in the field, atoms and molecules, enabling theoretical chemists to use computers and sophisticated mathematical techniques to understand the chemical behaviour of matter. </p>
      <p>Chemical thermodynamics deals with the relationship between heat and other forms of chemical energy, kinetics with chemical reaction rates. Subdisciplines of physical chemistry include electrochemistry, photochemistry (see photochemical reaction), surface chemistry, and catalysis.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Kinetics">
      <header>Kinetics</header>
      <p>Chemical kinetics is the branch of chemistry that deals with the rates or velocity, at which a chemical reaction occurs and also the factors affecting the rates. The word “kinetic” means the movement or change; here it refers to the velocity of a reaction, which is the change in the concentration of a reactant or a product with time.</p>
      <p>Kinetic investigation of a reaction is usually carried out with two main objectives in mind.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Analysis of the sequence of elementary reactions leading to the overall reaction. i.e. To arrive at the plausible reaction mechanism.</li>
        <li>Determination of absolute rate of the reaction.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>There are several reasons for studying the kinetics of a reaction. At the outset, there is an essential curiosity about “why some reactions are fast and some are slow?” Some phenomena, like photosynthesis, hydrocarbon combustion and nuclear reactions, take place on a time scale as short as pico seconds to micro seconds. Other processes like the setting and hardening of cement and the transformation of graphite to diamond, take longer period of time to complete. Practically, a good understanding of reaction rates is useful, in waste water treatment, in pollution control, in drug design and in food processing. Chemists working in industry give more importance to speed up the rate of a reaction and also to increase the productivity.</p>

       <header>Thermodynamics of mixing</header>
       <p>When solids, liquids or gases are combined, the thermodynamic quantities of the system experience a change as a result of the mixing. This module will discuss the effect that mixing has on a solution’s Gibbs energy, enthalpy, and entropy, with a specific focus on the mixing of two gases.</p>
       <p>A solution is created when two or more components mix homogeneously to form a single phase. Studying solutions is important because most chemical and biological life processes occur in systems with multiple components. Understanding the thermodynamic behavior of mixtures is integral to the study of any system involving either ideal or non-ideal solutions because it provides valuable information on the molecular properties of the system.</p>
       <p>Most real gases behave like ideal gases at standard temperature and pressure. This allows us to combine our knowledge of ideal systems and solutions with standard state thermodynamics in order to derive a set of equations that quantitatively describe the effect that mixing has on a given gas-phase solution’s thermodynamic quantities</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Statistical_Mechanics">
    <header>Statistical Mechanics</header>
      <p>Statistical mechanics or statistical thermodynamics is a branch of physics that applies probability theory, which contains mathematical tools for dealing with large populations, to the study of the thermodynamic behavior of systems composed of a large number of particles. Statistical mechanics provides a framework for relating the microscopic properties of individual atoms and molecules to the macroscopic bulk properties of materials that can be observed in everyday life, thereby explaining thermodynamics as a result of the classical- and quantum-mechanical descriptions of statistics and mechanics at the microscopic level.</p>
      <p>In statistical mechanics, Boltzmann's equation is a probability equation relating the entropy S of an ideal gas to the quantity W, the number of real microstates corresponding to the gas' macrostate:</p>
      <code>S = k<sub>B</sub> lnW</code>

  <section class="main-section" id="Quantum_Mechanics">
      <header>Quantum Mechanics</header>
      <p>Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics which involves the study of discrete and indivisible units of energy. These indivisible units are known as quanta. Thus it shows that some physical quantities can alter in some discrete units like angular momentum, energy etc. </p>
      <p>The dual behavior and the uncertainty principle describe the behavior of atomic scale objects like photon and electrons etc. The basic principle of Quantum mechanics is that particles like electrons have dual nature of particles and waves. The particles are randomly moved. It is not possible to know the position and the momentum of a particle at a time with accuracy. The atomic world is like the world where we live.</p>
      <h1>History of Quantum Mechanics</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>The concept of black body radiation was given by Gustav Kirchhoff in 1859. A black body is a perfect emitter and absorber. He proved that the emitted energy E of a black body is the function of temperature T and the frequency v of the emitted energy. So E = j (T,v) but it was not possible for him to find the function j.</li>
        <li>For this, Ludwig Boltzmann used the theoretical considerations of thermodynamics and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory but it was not successful. It does not specify the specific wavelengths. Then a formula was proposed by Planck in 1900 for Kirchhoff’s function.</li>
        <li>This formula was proved by all the experimental observation for wavelengths. For giving the theoretical derivation of the formula, he assumed that the total energy is made by quanta of energy which are indistinguishable energy elements. This also involved the Boltzmann’s statistical method.</li>
        <li>Ricci and Levi-Civita gave the general formulation of a tensor in 1901 but that is not proved by the quantum theory. After the photoelectric effect of Einstein, he gave the quantum theory of light and used some of the concepts of Planck's theory which was proved useful for the light quantum hypothesis.</li>
        <li>In 1906 Einstein showed that the change in energy in quantum material oscillator is multiples of v where is Planck's constant and v is the frequency.</li>
        <li>In 1913 Niels Bohr discovered the important laws of the spectral lines. Arthur Compton gave the derivation for the relativistic kinematics for the scattering of a photon or quantum of light of an electron.</li>
